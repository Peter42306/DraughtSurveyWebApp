        <li>Autofill the hydrostatic data based on previous inspections.</li>
        <li>Define commonly used draught ranges to speed up hydrostatic data entry.</li>
        <li>Keep all vessel and inspection data private and accessible only to the user who created it.</li>        
        <li>Add and update your notes during the inspection, even from mobile devices.</li>

        <li>Hand over an inspection to a colleague — one surveyor can start, another can finish.</li>
        <li>Enable teamwork: one surveyor records draught readings and ballast tanks soundings, while another enters hydrostatic data and performs tank-by-tank calculations.</li>     
        <li>Track inspection status to see at which stage each draught survey currently is.</li>
